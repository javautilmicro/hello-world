sample/test thing to explore the hows &amp; whys of: github

this is all just a bunch of garbage, being entered into a window not very much different than the one sitting in front of you now. it's just filler, so that the workflow of github might somehow be better understood by going through its complex nature, step by step, until it's making some kind of sense. Remember how scary it was to check shit in with CVS, that was a mess, and it never went as smoothly as it was intended. So we moved to a far more versatile and productive tool called, wait for the cleverness to wash over you, yeah, the next tool we used was called SVN, so the middle letter remained the same, and with it we gained a great deal of confidence in what we were attempting to do. Hell we got good enough to create our own branches and merging those alt-branches back into main, and then doing a release via some other branch, it was branch this and branch that, and it worked, so that was SVN, I didn't need anything more than that, it took care of all the details necessary to produce production quality code. So, why keep going, yeah, it's ind of silly, but the idea was that for some reason SVN was too slow, and wouldn't let you do things all the time, or something, read the git pages, they explain why we were in hell prior to it's initial release. and so that's where we are now, figuring out how to do good git work within this new github deal. 

[why]
why, well, because everyone is using this tech these days, and if you want to do tech you'll want to know git & github. Hell, just to ask someone a question you'll need some sort of presence, and that presence should be some what professional, and that's what this garbage is all about. making something that doesn't matter, but shows the workflow necessary to accomplish this task. it's silly, but necessary, and we'll keep messing around until this is like brushing your teeth, or maybe watching tv, just another miracle of modern day good times.
